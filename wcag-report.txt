Report: Adapting My Porfolio to WCAG Guidelines

1. The purpose of this report is to explain how this porfolio meets the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines(WCAG) 2.1 standard.

2. Accessibility principals Applied
    WCAG guidlines are organized into a group of 4 principals. This porfolio addresses these principals as follows:
    
    2.1 Perceivable
        * Text alternatives for non-text content: All images, icons, and logos have descriptive alt attributes 
        ensuring screen readers can convey the content.

        * Color contrast: background and foreground colors meet the WCAG minimum constrast of 4.5:1 for 
        normal text and 3:1 for large text, improving readability.

        * Scalable content: text can be resixed up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.

        * Media alternatives: N/a

    2.2 Operable
        * All interactive elements can be accessed and operated using a keyboard alone. Ive also added a "Skip to Content"
        that will skip the nav bar and set focus on the first content div under the hero.

        * Focus indicators: visible focus outlines are maintained on all interactive elements.

        * Logical tab order: the tab sequence follows logical reading order.

        * Responsive layout: The website adapts to difference screen sizes through the use of media queries and flex/grid sizing. 

    2.3 Understandable
        * Navigation menus and links maining a consistent structure in the SPA.

        * Clear language in headings labels and links.
        
        * Error identification: Forms provide clear feedback if required fields are missing or incorrectly filled.

    2.4 Robust

        * Semantic HTML is used throughout the website. 

        * Aria roles included where needed.

        * tested in safari and chrome.

The website scores a 100% on Accessibility when tested with lighthouse.
